This adapter was designed for the olympus microscopes but can be easily altered to suit any other microscope. It is made up of five pieces:
 -new_cross_piece: mainpiece on which phone is held
 -lock_ring_ols: Placed on the microscope eyepiece to create a perfect lock with the 'new_eye_piece' part
 -new_eye_piece: it is attached to the microscope eyepiece via the lock ring. It then acts as the attachment point for the cross_piece
 -new_side_holder: Three of these pieces are needed - one for each sliding groove on the cross_piece. They go hand in hand with the spindles. 
 -spindle: The spindle is used to tighten or loosen the side holders. They are placed on the bottom side of the cross_piece grooves. Nuts and bolts of an appropriate size should be acquired and trimmed to a desired length in order to be used with the side holder and spindle.

This folder contains both the '.dwg' and '.stl' files. The '.dwg' files can be used to furher customise the designs as needed. The '.stl' files can straight away be fed to a 3D printer for printing. NB: Some special care would need to be given to the printing process due to the negative spaces in some of the designs.
